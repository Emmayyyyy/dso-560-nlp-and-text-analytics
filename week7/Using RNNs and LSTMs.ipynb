Close monitoring is a must  when using like all high discharge batteies .

While searching, I came across these tokens.  Who knew?!?!  (I was not aware a product like this existed.)  On a whim, I bought a pack.... and I\\'m soooo glad I did!  Everyone loved playing with the lil\\' tokens.  Call me crazy... but I think the game is just more fun when you are using a miniature sheep for a sheep, a miniature wood for a wood, etc... instead of plain ole cards.  It was easy.  We each kept our pieces in a small non-see-through cup during play (you can also play with your resources visible to all).  Not to mention... they were just a fraction of the price of the replacement deck I was going to buy online!  We are very happy with our purchase.  :)\"\\n',\n",

There\\'s a game where you practice tracing the letter but we sometimes have trouble using the lightstick so we didn\\'t play it.

       " '\"For the price, then game is awesome for a 3 year-old! Mine LOVES it. Be prepared to want to shoot yourself in the head after playing it for the umpteenth time in a row, but fun enough to entertain a preschooler (though would get boring pretty fast for an older child). Gameplay is simple enough to allow for young kiddos to play independently of an adult (if that is an option for you!) For like the $5-6 I paid for it, the game is interchangeable for just cheap but pretty sturdy pirate toys (even recycle the sword into a safe, lightweight Halloween costume accessory), so worth the price on that note alone. On the one hand, I love that the map (which you can\\'t really see in the picture) is also a bag to hold the game, but would\\'ve preferred that the game packaging was reusable as a box as the map gets &#34;deformed&#34; by stuffing all the pieces in it and becomes somewhat of a pain to use as the flat playing surface necessary for the game (especially if you are not interested in pulling the little plastic stands off the treasure pieces every time which I imagine would also decrease the life of the pieces). This is of course easily solved by say putting it all in a gallon or bigger sized ziplock, or another box you have around, especially if you\\'d like it to stack nicely with your other games, but since I had to chuck all the packaging, would have been less wasteful if it was reusable. Overall, a fun and inexpensive game for the younger set which can be made super simple or a bit more challenging depending on how serious you are about hiding the treasure, and fun game/pirate-play pieces (just don\\'t lose them!).\"\\n',\n",

It reminds me of the cabbage patch kids craze when folks would pay hundreds for those, only difference is that they had no competition of any sort, whereas the American Girl Dolls have  tons of competition with other dolls of same size, idea, and quality. The Madame Alexander Dolls are a prime example.<br /><br />This doll is really cute and my daughter really likes her. She says that the doll is cute, her outfit is cute and she especially loves the boots, She has 2-3 other Madame Alexander dolls plus 2 of the Springfield Collection dolls (sold at Michaels craft stores - cute but there are differences that make them obviously less expensively made than the Madame Alexander & American Girls.)

There is a good distribution of the colors, blue was my favorite but orange and red/pink were the most popular.  These are a lot of fun, and the glowsticks were good into the next night.

My family members are bread bakers and artists and we like to be challenged.  After a tasty dinner and some beverages, we clear the table and jump in to this game that can surprise us as the scoring progresses.  Being that the dohdler or the dohdlees can all score, anything can happen.  Playing the game with a group that did not know each other well got off to a slower start, but once the testing of boundaries moved into the fine line between too obvious a sculpture and the obscure creation, we were entertained over the period of more than an hour.  Since the dough is reused, I insisted that all hands be washed prior to playing and nobody minded once they realized my motivation.  I expect that I will eventually be purchasing a replacement dough, though.\"\\n',\n",

The walls are double-layered to provide some extra integrity.<br /><br />I love that the windows are cut-out to allow you to see in/through, unlike Battlefront resin houses... it may not make a difference in play, because you still can\\'t identify units through the tiny windows, but it is a nice touch.<br /><br />The roof can be removed in three separate pieces.

I do not own or collect shopkins, but I have been looking for an organizer that is small and compact that I can use for my jewelry when traveling. My regular jewelry organizer that comes on a hanger is way to big to take with me. This organizer is exactly what I was looking for. The pockets fit eatings, rings, and necklaces. I love that I can zip up a row and have my jewelry stay securely in place. When I would previously travel, I would just lump all my jewelry in  a one pocket case and then when I needed to wear it, I would have all my necklaces tangled up in one giant mess and it was an absolute nightmare! Another great feature about this case is that it has a hook you can use to hang it up.  Additionally,  you can also fold the case and close it using the velcro.

       " '\"This toy is a knock-it-out-of-the-park hit.  Sure, the toy is, as one reviewer noted, &#34;limited play.&#34;  The &#34;limited&#34; part is that it does five things, and requires a ton of room, like a family room or a really big outdoor area.  Blaze does not work well on carpeting.  Though Blaze &#34;only&#34; does five things, periodically you get cued to give Blaze a hand, like filling his tires or revving his engine.<br /><br />Blaze is surprisingly heavy, but the weight is needed to help Blaze do his multiple stunts.  A lever automatically lowers to help Blaze do his various stunts.  Technically, Blaze only does five things, four of which are stunts, but Blaze seems to do a bit of ad-libbing from time to time that makes the five stunts seem like a lot more.  Blaze lifts up from the back, from the front, from the side, and does tail spins.  Blaze also talks and provides his own music.  Admittedly, the talking and music can get a little old, but it is so amusing to watch Blaze do tricks that we had little time to be bored.<br /><br />The only &#34;down side&#34; to Blaze is that Blaze requires a LOT of area without carpeting to do his stunts.  Blaze does have a power mode that works okay on carpet, but any stunts that use the automatic lever work much better on a relatively smooth surface, like a concrete or hardwood floor.<br /><br />We have had many different toy vehicles over the decades, some of which were nearly the cost of this vehicle.  Many of those vehicles only did one thing.  Occasionally they might do something else, like pop a wheelie.  But none of those vehicles would do all the things this vehicle will do.  Frankly, I would have loved this toy as a child.  What the heck, I love this toy as an adult.  Then there are the grandchildren, if they can get it away from grandpa.<br /><br />Enjoy!\"\\n',\n",

It took about 7 minutes in total to prep for my daughter.<br /><br />What I really like about this set is how it stimulates my daughter’s imaginative play.

It even comes with one.  So if you are like me, and prefer the feel of an octagonal restrictor gate, there\\'s going to be a learning curve.  When you switch gates like that, you end up losing roughly half of the diagonal sensitivity, because of the way the microswitches are placed.  So while you have a smoother overall motion, you need to be very deliberate in hitting all of the directions.<br /><br />Now this isn\\'t a knock against the joystick, even though it may seem like it.  This is more of a warning to anyone who might be thinking of switching the gate out.  And even then, the replacement gates are pretty cheap, and take about 20 seconds to install.  I\\'m still quite happy I put one of these in my arcade stick, because they feel great to use, and it contrasts well with my black case.<br /><br />So as far as I\\'m concerned, this is the best joystick I\\'ve used.

I was so excited when my daughter got this for her daughter - as I have many fond memories of both of my children playing with their cozy coup\\'s when they were toddlers.  The design hasn\\'t changed a lot in the over 25 years since my kids had these - I guess if something isn\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.  One nice feature about the newer models is they are taller and I am able to push my 18 month old granddaughter in her &#34;car&#34; without it breaking my back.  I am only 5\\'5&#34; and I think anyone much taller then me would have to bend though.<br /><br />I put the coup together and used the on-line video instruction and it made the job very easy.  I did it by myself and had no issues.  I am a visual person so this was much better than the instruction manual.  Following the video step-by-step will assure you don\\'t put anything together bassackwards .... you do not want to try and take this baby apart believe me.  After I put it together we took it for a few spins in the house on the hardwood floors and one of the front wheels did not operate properly - it was kind of &#34;frozen&#34; and wouldn\\'t swivel like it should.  I called Little Tikes and their rep was very friendly and helpful.  Once we took it outside on the concrete it worked perfectly.  Couldn\\'t get the necessary traction inside (probably not an ideal inside toy anyway but with grandparents, we have a whole different set of rules than we did for our own kids lol!) .<br /><br />Get one of these for your kids or grandkids - they will love it - and so will you.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Iron Maiden has always featured Eddie &#34;The Head&#34; on all of their album artwork, as well as in their stage performances. This particular Eddie is represented on the album Piece of Mind.<br /><br />I\\'ve never owned one of the new NECA mego styled figures, so I had no idea what to expect. I\\'m glad I got this one, he is quite an awesome figure.<br /><br />The sculpt of his head is a dead on representation of the album artwork, and the face is scary as it should be. Every detail was paid attention too, down to the tiny screws holding the plate that holds his head together. This is one of the best head sculpts I have ever seen on an action figure. The feet are sculpted equally grotesque, and they look appropriately Eddie. From the knee up, however, he is a plain, flesh toned &#34;buck&#34; body. His collar around his neck is very well sculpted as well, straight down to the tiny little lock that looks as though it holds it shut. It even features real metal chains attached to it.<br /><br />Paint on Eddie is fantastic. The face is so detailed that Eddie appears to have crawled right out of the album artwork. His teeth, tongue, eyes, and even the bit of blood dripping from his skull cap are expertly applied. The only thing that costs this figure points on paint is that NECA have decided to &#34;shade&#34; the head and collar like on the album artwork, and not on the clothes, so he looks to be half shaded. Even with the jarring paint shading on his head and collar, he is still an amazing portrayal of Eddie.<br /><br />The cloth clothes are very nice, in my opinion. His jeans are appropriately ripped and have been &#34;stained&#34; to appear dirty. The straightjacket is amazing, and has lots of straps on the back as it should. Both the pants and straightjacket have Velcro on them, and while the pants are easily removed, I can not see any way to take the straightjacket off without damaging it. Looks like Eddie is permanently restrained.<br /><br />The articulation on Eddie is pretty good too. He has a double ball jointed head/neck that allows a nice range of motion, though it is a little tight. His legs have hinged hips, swivel thighs, hinged knees, and hinged ankles. The legs allow a nice range of motion, however it does feel slightly limited due to the cloth jeans. The upper body has a waist swivel, and the arms are as articulated as the legs. The straightjacket however prevents most motion though, and while his arms are slightly movable, they will never have the range of articulation that other figures have.<br /><br />Overall, this NECA mego styled Eddie, from the classic Iron Maiden album Piece of Mind, is a must have for fans of the band and these NECA figures. Highly reccomended.\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"Pro\\'s: 1)  RC car is great for my 7 y/o.  Bought it for his birthday.  Its quick, fun, and tears through most anything he hits.  Drives very fast on the driveway and road.  Hits the unmowed lawn with speed and maintains it throughout.  Up and down ditches like a champ.  Through mulched beds with ease.  He drives it through the forest in the back yard over hills and dirt bike ramps with ease too. 2) For a 7 y/o it took a few runs to get used to the skid steer, but that was expected. 3) OUTSTANDING customer service.  His left wheels started to \\'stick\\' causing the car to not drive straight when commanded.  This happened w/in 3 months of purchase.  Emailed Kidzlane, and they took care of it with ease!  Very impressed with their desire to maintain good customer relations!  Thanks Kidzlane!  Cons: 1) Easy to flip.  If he drives to hard into a steep hill, or hits reverse on both wheels when going full speed forward, the vehicle will flip.  No biggie, but it scratches the roof. 2) Battery installation is difficult, requiring a screwdriver (provided).  Understand it\\'s needed to keep watertight battery compartment, but I would think a quick latch system would work. 3) Battery life can be less than desired.  Quick solution was to purchase additional batteries for hours of fun.  Overall - this car is a beast for it\\'s price, and my boy is loving every minute of it.  Kidzlane has been outstanding in their service.  Highly recommend purchasing this if you are considering an inexpensive RC car for your child.  Update, Dec 2015. I can\\'t praise the Customer service of Kidzlane enough!  Our toy broke again, a plastic gear in the wheels stripped.  Kidzlane replaced for free!  If you like amazing Customer service - Go with these guys!\"\\n',\n",

We place a tarp or outdoor blanket under it to help keep it clean and protect from any missed sharp objects. Take down is a little more work and requires a little more time but I am able to do it in under 20 minutes.

(For some reason, the newer AMT Round 2 model of this kit isn\\'t available at all anywhere that I could find.) Last week, when I saw it was down to $24.99, I knew I couldn\\'t pass that up. Package arrived mint-in-box, and, even though one corner was a little crumpled, everything inside was still wrapped and in new condition. I was extremely pleased with how well the pieces of this kit went together. With the other kits from 20+ years ago, I\\'d always had trouble with some pieces not fitting correctly due to age and/or warping. But I got lucky with this one. Everything fit and glued together just like it was supposed to. And, as usual, I went with my own color scheme. It looks great sitting on my shelf next to the battlecruiser from Star Trek VI.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I purchased a second kit, and I decided to try a different color scheme. (Plus, I think I like the attack mode wing configuration better than the flight mode.) Although I\\'m still not sure I chose the right shade of green for the ship\\'s hull, I definitely like the second color scheme better than the first.\"\\n',\n",
